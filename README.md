# Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions

Building AI course project

##Summary
A machine learning system designed to analyze banking transactions and detect fraudulent activities. It identifies suspicious patterns, minimizes financial losses, and ensures users' financial security in real time.

## **Background**
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions are a growing problem, impacting consumers and financial institutions:

**Global Impact:** Financial losses due to fraud exceed billions of dollars annually.
**Personal Impact:** Millions of individuals face stress and loss of funds due to fraud.
**Proposed Solution:** Leverage AI to detect fraudulent activities in real-time, minimizing losses and improving trust in financial systems.

## **Motivation**
Enhance financial security for users and institutions.
Reduce operational costs associated with fraud investigation.
Build user trust through reliable fraud detection mechanisms.

## **How is it used?**

**Workflow**
Input: Transaction details (e.g., amount, time, location, account history).
Processing: Machine learning models analyze patterns and detect anomalies.
Output: Fraud detection results (fraudulent or legitimate), along with fraud scores.

**Usage Scenario**
Banking Systems: Integrated into banking applications for real-time fraud monitoring.
Alerts: Notify banks or users of suspicious transactions.
Reports: Detailed transaction analysis for further investigation.

### **Workflow**
- **Input**: Transaction data (e.g., amount, time, location).
- **Processing**: AI models analyze patterns.
- **Output**: Fraud detection result (fraudulent or legitimate) based on probabilities.

## **Data Sources and AI Techniques**
### **Data Sources**
The data can be generated or obtained from public repositories, such as:
- [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection)

### **AI Techniques**
1. **Decision Trees**: To identify decision patterns for classifying fraudulent transactions.
2. **Neural Networks**: To find complex correlations in large datasets.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Algorithms like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.

## **Challenges**
- **False Positives**: Balancing accuracy to avoid flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Most transactions are legitimate, making it challenging to train models on imbalanced datasets.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring the security and anonymization of sensitive user data.

## **What Next?**
1. **Advanced Model Training**: Experiment with different models to improve accuracy.
2. **Real-Time Implementation**: Build an API for live transaction processing.
3. **User Interface**: Create dashboards for financial institutions to monitor fraud.
