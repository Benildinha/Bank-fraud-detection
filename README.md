# Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions

## Summary
A machine learning system that detects fraudulent banking transactions in real-time. It identifies suspicious patterns, minimizes financial losses, and enhances users' financial security.  

Building AI course project

## Background
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions are a growing problem, impacting consumers and financial institutions.  

**Global Impact:** Financial losses due to fraud exceed billions of dollars annually.  
**Personal Impact:** Millions of individuals face stress and loss of funds due to fraud.  
**Proposed Solution:** Leverage AI to detect fraudulent activities in real-time, minimizing losses and improving trust in financial systems.

## Motivation
Enhance financial security for users and institutions.  
Reduce operational costs associated with fraud investigation.  
Build user trust through reliable fraud detection mechanisms.

## How is it used?

### Workflow
- **Input:** Transaction details (e.g., amount, time, location, account history).  
- **Processing:** Machine learning models analyze patterns and detect anomalies.  
- **Output:** Fraud detection results (fraudulent or legitimate), along with fraud scores.

### Usage Scenario
- **Banking Systems:** Integrated into banking applications for real-time fraud monitoring.  
- **Alerts:** Notify banks or users of suspicious transactions.  
- **Reports:** Provide detailed transaction analysis for further investigation.

## Data Sources and AI Techniques

### Data Sources
The data can be generated or obtained from public repositories, such as:  
- [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection)

### AI Techniques
1. **Decision Trees:** To identify decision patterns for classifying fraudulent transactions.  
2. **Neural Networks:** To find complex correlations in large datasets.  
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.

## Challenges
- **False Positives:** Balancing accuracy to avoid flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent.  
- **Imbalanced Data:** Most transactions are legitimate, making it challenging to train models on imbalanced datasets.  
- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring the security and anonymization of sensitive user data.

## What Next?
1. **Advanced Model Training:** Experiment with different models to improve accuracy.  
2. **Real-Time Implementation:** Build an API for live transaction processing.  
3. **User Interface:** Create dashboards for financial institutions to monitor fraud.
