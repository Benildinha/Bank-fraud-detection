# Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions

Building AI course project

## **Summary**
A system that analyzes banking transactions to detect fraudulent activities. It uses machine learning algorithms to identify anomalous patterns and ensure users' financial security.

## **Background**
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions are a growing problem, impacting both consumers and financial institutions.
* **Global impact**: Financial losses due to fraud exceed billions of dollars annually.
* **Proposed solution**: Create a system that detects suspicious patterns in real time, reducing losses and protecting users.

## **How is it used?**
1. The system collects and analyzes data from banking transactions.
2. Machine learning algorithms identify unusual activities.
3. The system automatically alerts banks or users to review suspicious transactions.

### **Workflow**
- **Input**: Transaction data (e.g., amount, time, location).
- **Processing**: AI models analyze patterns.
- **Output**: Fraud detection result (fraudulent or legitimate) based on probabilities.

## **Data Sources and AI Techniques**
### **Data Sources**
The data can be generated or obtained from public repositories, such as:
- [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection)

### **AI Techniques**
1. **Decision Trees**: To identify decision patterns for classifying fraudulent transactions.
2. **Neural Networks**: To find complex correlations in large datasets.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Algorithms like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders.

## **Challenges**
- **False Positives**: Balancing accuracy to avoid flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Most transactions are legitimate, making it challenging to train models on imbalanced datasets.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring the security and anonymization of sensitive user data.

## **What Next?**
1. **Advanced Model Training**: Experiment with different models to improve accuracy.
2. **Real-Time Implementation**: Build an API for live transaction processing.
3. **User Interface**: Create dashboards for financial institutions to monitor fraud.
